Before build, you need to create `.env` or `.env.production` file to set certain environment variables. It should include `VITE_BASE_URL` and `VITE_WEB_URL`. And if you use [Microsoft Clarity](https://clarity.microsoft.com/) for analytics, you can also add `VITE_CLARITY_KEY` here.

```
VITE_BASE_URL=https://static/meta/file/endpoint
VITE_WEB_URL=https://metrognome.top
VITE_CLARITY_KEY=your-clarity-key (optional)
```
